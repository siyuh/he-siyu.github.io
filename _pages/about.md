I am co-advised by [Dr. Kam Leong](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/kam-leong) and [Dr. Elham Azizi](https://www.bme.columbia.edu/faculty/elham-azizi). My reearch interests lie at the interface of stem cell engineering, disease modeling, statistical machine learning and computational biology.
