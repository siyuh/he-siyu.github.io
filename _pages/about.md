Hi, I am Siyu, currently a 5th-year phd candidate in [Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). I am co-advised by [Dr. Kam Leong](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/kam-leong) and [Dr. Elham Azizi](https://www.bme.columbia.edu/faculty/elham-azizi). My reearch interests lie at the interface of stem cell engineering, disease modeling, statistical machine learning and computational biology.

You can also find my profile from [Leong Lab](https://leonglab.bme.columbia.edu/), [Azizi Lab](https://www.azizilab.com/members.html), or [Cancer dynamics](https://cancerdynamics.columbia.edu/content/siyu-he).
